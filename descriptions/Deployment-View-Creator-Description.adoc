=== Purpose
The Deployment View Creator prompt helps systematically design and document comprehensive deployment architectures that address operational requirements, infrastructure decisions, and deployment strategies. It creates detailed deployment views following arc42 Chapter 7 principles, ensuring that infrastructure decisions are operationally-driven and well-documented.

=== When to Use
* Designing deployment architectures for new software systems
* Creating arc42 Chapter 7 (Deployment View) documentation
* When operational requirements are defined but deployment approach is unclear
* Before major infrastructure decisions that will shape system operations
* When planning cloud migration or infrastructure modernization
* During architecture reviews to validate deployment strategies
* When transitioning from solution design to operational implementation
* For complex systems requiring comprehensive infrastructure planning

=== What It Produces
* **Operationally-Driven Architecture**: Deployment solutions directly tied to operational requirements
* **Infrastructure Design**: Comprehensive infrastructure topology and component specifications
* **Environment Strategy**: Multi-environment approach with promotion and deployment processes
* **Network Architecture**: Security-focused network design with traffic flow documentation
* **Deployment Automation**: CI/CD integration and deployment pattern recommendations
* **Operational Procedures**: Monitoring, disaster recovery, and capacity planning strategies
* **Cost Optimization**: Resource optimization and cost management strategies

=== Key Benefits
* **Operations-Focused**: Ensures every infrastructure decision supports operational requirements
* **Systematic Approach**: 6-step process covers all aspects of deployment architecture
* **Decision Traceability**: Clear rationale linking operational goals to infrastructure decisions
* **Implementation Guidance**: Actionable deployment strategies and automation approaches
* **Risk Management**: Proactive identification and mitigation of operational risks
* **Cost Awareness**: Explicit consideration of cost optimization and resource efficiency

=== Integration with arc42
This prompt directly supports arc42 Chapter 7 (Deployment View) and connects to:

* **Chapter 1 (Introduction and Goals)**: Operational goals provide foundation for deployment decisions
* **Chapter 3 (System Scope and Context)**: External infrastructure constraints influence deployment
* **Chapter 4 (Solution Strategy)**: Deployment architecture realizes strategic technology decisions
* **Chapter 6 (Runtime View)**: Deployment supports runtime behavior and quality scenarios
* **Chapter 9 (Architecture Decisions)**: Infrastructure decisions become formal ADRs
* **Chapter 10 (Quality Requirements)**: Deployment architecture enables quality attribute achievement
* **Chapter 11 (Risk and Technical Debt)**: Operational risks feed into risk management

The deployment view serves as the bridge between logical architecture design and physical infrastructure implementation, ensuring all operational concerns are properly addressed.

=== Special Features
* **Multi-Environment Strategy**: Comprehensive approach to dev, test, staging, and production environments
* **Security-First Design**: Integrated security architecture with network segmentation and access control
* **Cloud-Native Patterns**: Support for modern deployment patterns like containers, serverless, and microservices
* **Operational Excellence**: Focus on monitoring, automation, and operational procedures
* **Disaster Recovery Planning**: Comprehensive backup, recovery, and business continuity strategies
* **Cost Optimization**: Systematic approach to resource efficiency and cost management
* **Compliance Integration**: Built-in consideration of regulatory and compliance requirements
* **Evolution Planning**: Strategies for infrastructure modernization and technology refresh
