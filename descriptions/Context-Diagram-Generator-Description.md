# Context Diagram Generator Prompt Description

## Purpose
The Context Diagram Generator prompt helps systematically create comprehensive system context diagrams following C4 Model Level 1 principles. It produces visual representations that clearly show system boundaries, external entities, people, and data flows, serving as a foundation for architecture communication and system understanding.

## When to Use
- Starting architectural documentation for a new system
- Creating arc42 Chapter 3 (System Scope and Context) documentation
- Communicating system boundaries to stakeholders
- Onboarding new team members to understand system ecosystem
- Planning system integrations and dependencies
- Conducting architecture reviews and assessments
- Documenting existing systems for modernization projects
- Supporting compliance and audit requirements

## What It Produces
- **High-Level Context Diagram**: Clean C4 Level 1 system context view
- **Detailed Context Diagram**: Comprehensive view with all external entities
- **Stakeholder Analysis Table**: Detailed breakdown of people and their roles
- **External Systems Matrix**: Integration patterns and communication details
- **Business Process Context**: Sequence diagrams showing key workflows
- **Technical Architecture Context**: Protocols, formats, and technical requirements
- **Multiple Specialized Views**: Security, data, business process, and deployment perspectives

## Key Benefits
- **C4 Model Compliance**: Follows established architecture visualization standards
- **Systematic Approach**: 6-step process ensures comprehensive coverage
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Business, technical, security, and data views
- **Integration Planning**: Clear understanding of external dependencies
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Visual format accessible to non-technical audiences
- **Documentation Foundation**: Provides basis for detailed architecture documentation

## Integration with arc42
This prompt directly supports several arc42 chapters:
- **Chapter 3 (System Scope and Context)**: Primary focus with both business and technical context
- **Chapter 1 (Introduction and Goals)**: System purpose and stakeholder identification
- **Chapter 2 (Architecture Constraints)**: External system dependencies and constraints
- **Chapter 8 (Cross-cutting Concepts)**: Integration patterns and communication protocols
- **Chapter 11 (Risk and Technical Debt)**: Dependency risks and integration complexity

The context diagrams serve as a visual anchor for architecture documentation, helping readers understand the system's place in the broader ecosystem before diving into internal architecture details.

## Special Features
- **Multiple Diagram Types**: High-level overview and detailed technical views
- **PlantUML C4 Integration**: Uses C4-PlantUML library for consistent, professional diagrams
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Connects context diagrams to stakeholder analysis
- **Business Process Integration**: Shows how technical context supports business processes
- **Evolution Planning**: Considers future state and planned changes
- **Security Context**: Special focus on security boundaries and trust zones
