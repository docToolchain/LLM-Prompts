=== Purpose
The Stakeholder Analysis prompt helps systematically identify, analyze, and document all relevant stakeholders for a software system. It creates a comprehensive stakeholder register that supports effective architecture communication and decision-making throughout the system lifecycle.

=== When to Use
* Starting a new software architecture project
* When architecture communication is challenging or ineffective  
* Before major architecture decisions that affect multiple parties
* When stakeholder requirements seem unclear or conflicting
* During architecture reviews or governance processes
* When planning architecture documentation and communication strategies

=== What It Produces
* **Comprehensive Stakeholder Register**: Detailed analysis of all relevant stakeholders
* **Influence-Interest Matrix**: Visual classification showing stakeholder power dynamics
* **Communication Strategy**: Tailored communication approaches for each stakeholder group
* **Architecture Views Mapping**: Clear mapping of which stakeholders need which architectural perspectives
* **Stakeholder Ecosystem Diagram**: Visual representation of stakeholder relationships

=== Key Benefits
* **Systematic Approach**: Ensures no important stakeholders are overlooked
* **Communication Planning**: Creates targeted communication strategies for different audiences
* **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies potential conflicts and resistance early
* **Decision Support**: Clarifies who needs to be involved in architecture decisions
* **Documentation Guidance**: Determines what architecture views and detail levels are needed

=== Integration with arc42
This prompt particularly supports:

* **Chapter 1 (Introduction)**: Understanding business context and stakeholder landscape
* **Chapter 2 (Constraints)**: Identifying organizational and stakeholder-driven constraints  
* **Chapter 12 (Glossary)**: Defining stakeholder roles and responsibilities
* Architecture communication planning across all chapters

The stakeholder analysis serves as a foundation for effective architecture documentation by ensuring all relevant perspectives are considered and appropriately addressed.
