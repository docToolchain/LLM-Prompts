This document provides consolidated system prompts for creating specialized AI assistants focused on software architecture documentation using arc42, docToolchain, and related methodologies.

== Overview

These prompts transform LLMs into expert architecture assistants that can:

* Structure architecture thinking systematically  
* Generate consistent, high-quality documentation
* Follow established methodologies like arc42
* Create visual diagrams and decision records
* Maintain documentation as living artifacts

All prompts generate **AsciiDoc output** compatible with **docToolchain** workflows and include **PlantUML/C4 diagrams** for visual documentation.

== Complete Architecture Assistant (All Capabilities)

This mega-prompt combines all architecture documentation capabilities into a single comprehensive system prompt.

== Usage Instructions

=== For LLM Platforms

1. **Copy the desired prompt combination** from the source blocks above
2. **Paste into your LLM interface** as a system prompt or initial message
3. **Begin your architecture work** - the AI will guide you through structured processes

=== For AI Assistant Creation

1. **Select the appropriate combination** based on your needs:
   - **Complete Architecture Assistant**: All capabilities
   - **Core Tools**: Essential functionality only  
   - **Specialized**: Advanced arc42-specific tools
   - **Quick Start**: Focused combinations for specific workflows

2. **Use as system prompts** in platforms like:
   - Claude Projects (Anthropic)
   - GPTs (OpenAI)
   - Custom AI assistants
   - API implementations

=== Integration with docToolchain

All generated outputs are designed to work seamlessly with docToolchain:

```bash
# Process generated AsciiDoc files
./dtcw generateHTML
./dtcw generatePDF
./dtcw publishToConfluence
```

== Prompt Characteristics

=== Consistent Style Elements

All prompts in this collection share:

* **Structured approach**: Step-by-step guided processes
* **Quality focus**: Decisions tied to measurable quality goals  
* **Visual integration**: PlantUML/C4 diagrams embedded
* **arc42 alignment**: Direct support for arc42 methodology
* **AsciiDoc output**: Compatible with docToolchain workflows
* **Comprehensive templates**: Ready-to-use documentation structures

=== Interaction Patterns

* **Question-driven**: Prompts ask targeted questions to gather requirements
* **Iterative refinement**: Support for multiple rounds of improvement
* **Decision traceability**: Clear rationale for all architectural choices
* **Stakeholder focus**: Consider multiple perspectives and communication needs
* **Implementation guidance**: Actionable next steps and validation approaches

=== Integration Benefits

When used together, these prompts provide:

* **End-to-end coverage**: From high-level strategy to operational implementation
* **Consistent terminology**: Shared vocabulary across all documentation
* **Traceability**: Clear links between different architectural concerns
* **Workflow continuity**: Outputs from one prompt feed naturally into others
* **Quality coherence**: Unified approach to quality-driven architecture

== Examples and Templates

=== Creating a Complete Architecture Documentation Set

1. **Start with Architecture Communication Canvas** - Get the big picture
2. **Use Stakeholder Analysis** - Understand who needs what
3. **Create Context Diagrams** - Establish system boundaries
4. **Build Quality Scenarios** - Define measurable requirements  
5. **Develop Solution Strategy** - Bridge requirements to decisions
6. **Document Architecture Decisions** - Capture key choices
7. **Plan Deployment** - Address operational concerns
8. **Assess Risks** - Identify and mitigate threats
9. **Track Technical Debt** - Manage long-term code health

=== Typical Workflow Integration

```
Stakeholder Analysis → Context Diagrams → Quality Scenarios 
         ↓
Solution Strategy → Architecture Decisions → Deployment View
         ↓  
Risk Assessment → Technical Debt Tracking → Documentation
```

=== Output Integration

All prompts generate documentation that can be combined into comprehensive arc42 documentation:

* **Chapter 1**: Introduction and Goals (Architecture Communication Canvas)
* **Chapter 3**: System Scope and Context (Context Diagram Generator)  
* **Chapter 4**: Solution Strategy (Solution Strategy Planner)
* **Chapter 7**: Deployment View (Deployment View Creator)
* **Chapter 9**: Architecture Decisions (Architecture Decision Record)
* **Chapter 10**: Quality Requirements (Quality Scenarios Builder)
* **Chapter 11**: Risk and Technical Debt (Risk Assessment, Technical Debt Tracker)

== Contributing

To maintain consistency across all prompts:

1. **Follow the established style patterns** shown in existing prompts
2. **Use consistent terminology** (AsciiDoc, arc42, PlantUML, etc.)
3. **Maintain structured approaches** with clear step-by-step processes
4. **Include visual elements** using PlantUML/C4 notation
5. **Ensure quality focus** in all architectural decisions
6. **Test integration** with other prompts in the collection
