=== Purpose
The Solution Strategy Planner prompt helps systematically develop comprehensive solution strategies that directly address identified quality goals and scenarios. It creates detailed strategic approaches following arc42 Chapter 4 principles, ensuring that architectural decisions are quality-driven and well-documented.

=== When to Use
* Developing solution strategies for new software systems
* Creating arc42 Chapter 4 (Solution Strategy) documentation
* When quality goals and scenarios are defined but solution approach is unclear
* Before major architectural decisions that will shape the system
* When balancing multiple quality attributes with conflicting requirements
* During architecture reviews to validate strategic decisions
* When transitioning from requirements to solution design
* For complex systems requiring comprehensive strategic planning

=== What It Produces
* **Quality-Driven Strategy**: Solutions directly tied to specific quality goals and scenarios
* **Technology Strategy**: Comprehensive technology decisions with rationale
* **Decomposition Strategy**: System structure and component boundaries
* **Quality Achievement Strategy**: Specific mechanisms for achieving quality goals
* **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased approach to realizing the strategy
* **Risk Assessment**: Strategic risks and mitigation approaches
* **Trade-off Analysis**: Documented decisions and alternatives considered

=== Key Benefits
* **Quality-Focused**: Ensures every strategic decision supports specific quality goals
* **Systematic Approach**: 6-step process covers all aspects of solution strategy
* **Decision Traceability**: Clear rationale linking quality goals to architectural decisions
* **Implementation Guidance**: Actionable roadmap for realizing the strategy
* **Risk Management**: Proactive identification and mitigation of strategic risks
* **Trade-off Documentation**: Explicit documentation of decisions and alternatives

=== Integration with arc42
This prompt directly supports arc42 Chapter 4 (Solution Strategy) and connects to:

* **Chapter 1 (Introduction and Goals)**: Quality goals provide foundation for strategy
* **Chapter 3 (System Scope and Context)**: External constraints influence strategic decisions
* **Chapter 5 (Building Block View)**: Decomposition strategy guides system structure
* **Chapter 6 (Runtime View)**: Quality achievement mechanisms inform dynamic behavior
* **Chapter 9 (Architecture Decisions)**: Strategic decisions become formal ADRs
* **Chapter 11 (Risk and Technical Debt)**: Strategic risks feed into risk management

The solution strategy serves as a bridge between quality requirements and detailed architecture design, ensuring all subsequent architectural work remains aligned with strategic objectives.

=== Special Features
* **Quality Scenarios Integration**: Strategy directly addresses specific, measurable quality requirements
* **Multiple Strategy Types**: Technology, decomposition, quality achievement, and implementation strategies
* **Visual Strategy Models**: PlantUML diagrams showing strategic approaches and relationships
* **Implementation Planning**: Concrete roadmap with phases, milestones, and validation approaches
* **Evolution Strategy**: Plans for how architecture will adapt and evolve over time
* **Governance Integration**: Approaches for ensuring strategy compliance during development
