    A[1. Canvas] --> B[2. arc42]
    B --> C[3. Quality]
    C --> D[4. Decisions] 
    D --> E[5. Risks]
    E --> F[6. Debt]
    
    A -.->|"Get big picture"| A1[Architecture Communication Canvas]
    B -.->|"Create comprehensive docs"| B1[arc42 Chapter Generator]
    C -.->|"Define testable requirements"| C1[Quality Scenarios Builder]

    E -.->|"Identify and mitigate"| E1[Risk Assessment Matrix]
    F -.->|"Manage code health"| F1[Technical Debt Tracker]
```

=== Step-by-Step Guide

. **Start with Architecture Communication Canvas** - Get the big picture and identify key stakeholders, core functions, and value proposition
. **Use arc42 Chapter Generator** - Create comprehensive documentation structure following proven methodology
. **Build Quality Scenarios** - Define testable quality requirements with specific success criteria
. **Create Architecture Decision Records** - Document and justify key architectural decisions with structured evaluation
. **Assess Risks** - Identify potential problems early and develop mitigation strategies
. **Track Technical Debt** - Manage long-term system health and plan refactoring activities

== üîß docToolchain Integration [[integration]]

These prompts are designed to work seamlessly with https://doctoolchain.org[docToolchain] workflows:

=== Output Compatibility
* **AsciiDoc Format**: All outputs are in AsciiDoc format for seamless integration
* **PlantUML Diagrams**: Diagrams use PlantUML/Kroki for automatic rendering
* **arc42 Structure**: Compatible with standard arc42 template organization
* **Version Control**: Documentation can be managed with Git like source code

=== Integration Workflow
[source,bash]
----
# Generate HTML documentation
./dtcw generateHTML

# Generate PDF documentation  
./dtcw generatePDF

# Publish to Confluence
./dtcw publishToConfluence

# Generate complete site
./dtcw generateSite
----

=== Configuration Tips
* Use the provided `docToolchainConfig.groovy` as a starting point
* Customize output paths and formats based on your needs
* Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automatic documentation updates
* Consider using Confluence publishing for stakeholder access

== üé® Customization Guide [[customization]]

These prompts are designed to be highly customizable for your specific context:

=== Adaptation Strategies
. **Domain-Specific Terminology**: Replace generic terms with your industry-specific language
