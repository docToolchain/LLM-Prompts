[abstract]
== Abstract

This collection provides carefully crafted LLM prompts designed to assist software architects, developers, and technical writers in creating high-quality architecture documentation. Each prompt is designed to work with modern Large Language Models to generate structured, comprehensive documentation following established frameworks like arc42.

== Introduction

Software architecture documentation is crucial for project success, but creating comprehensive, consistent documentation can be time-consuming and challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude, ChatGPT, or others can significantly accelerate this process when provided with well-structured prompts.

This collection contains proven prompts for:

* Architecture Communication Canvas creation
* Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
* Quality scenarios and requirements
* Risk assessment matrices
* Technical debt tracking
* arc42 chapter generation

Each prompt is designed to guide the LLM through a structured conversation, ensuring all necessary information is gathered and properly documented.

== How to Use These Prompts

=== General Guidelines

1. **Start with Context**: Always provide the LLM with sufficient context about your project, technology stack, and constraints.

2. **Iterate and Refine**: These prompts are designed for interactive sessions. Don't expect perfect results on the first try.

3. **Validate Results**: Always review and validate the generated content with your team and stakeholders.

4. **Customize**: Adapt the prompts to your specific needs, industry, or organizational standards.

=== Integration with Tools

These prompts work best when integrated with documentation tools like:

* **docToolchain**: For generating professional documentation from AsciiDoc
* **Confluence**: For collaborative documentation platforms
* **Git repositories**: For version-controlled documentation-as-code approaches
