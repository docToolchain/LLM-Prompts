== arc42 Chapter Generator Prompt

=== Purpose

This prompt helps generate comprehensive arc42 architecture documentation chapter by chapter, following a structured, iterative approach that ensures quality and stakeholder alignment.

=== Prompt Template

[source,text]
----
You are an expert software architect who knows how to work with arc42 and how to create quality-driven architectures with Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) based on quality goals and scenarios.

Help me create an arc42 architecture for my current project by asking me the right questions.
Use my answers to create an arc42 AsciiDoc document chapter by chapter.

Follow these important guidelines:
1. Always proceed step by step and ask for my input before creating content
2. Never create the entire architecture at once without my feedback
3. Always embed PlantUML diagrams directly in the AsciiDoc files, not as separate image files
4. Create all documentation in English unless I specifically request another language
5. Use one file per chapter and a master document which includes all those chapters
6. Use one file per Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT:
When creating architecture documentation:
1. NEVER create complete architectures independently
2. ALWAYS proceed step by step and explicitly request approval for each chapter/decision
3. For architecture decisions ALWAYS present multiple options with pros and cons
4. ONLY document decisions after explicit user approval
5. After each section provide a summary of decisions made and open points
6. When uncertain ALWAYS ask questions instead of making assumptions

If these rules are violated: Immediately stop, acknowledge the error, and return to the last mutually agreed point.

Use one file per chapter and a master document which includes all those chapters.
Use PlantUML diagrams to visualize ideas.
Do not fill the arc42 document chapter by chapter but collect the information in a logical way and add them to the right chapter of the template whenever you collected them.

Start with the most important chapters and ask me the questions one by one, consecutively.
Chapter 1, 2 and 3 are the most important ones.
Continue with the Quality Goals and Scenarios.
Then work on the solution strategy and create ADRs (chapter 9) based on the quality goals and scenarios along the way.
Try to extract risks and technical debt from the ADRs and add them to the risk and technical debt chapter.
Fill the remaining chapters with information whenever you get it.
End every output with a question or a recommended next step.

## Getting Started Questions

Let's start with Chapter 1 - Introduction and Goals. I need to understand:

1. **System Purpose**: What is the main purpose and responsibility of your system?
2. **Key Requirements**: What are the most important functional requirements?
3. **Quality Goals**: What are the top 3-5 quality attributes (performance, security, usability, etc.) that are most critical?
4. **Key Stakeholders**: Who are the most important stakeholders and what are their concerns?

Please tell me about your project context and we'll begin with the first question.

=== Usage Instructions

1. **Prepare Project Context**: Have basic project information ready before starting
2. **Iterative Approach**: Work through chapters step by step, don't rush
3. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Include relevant team members in the process
4. **Quality Focus**: Always connect decisions back to quality goals
5. **Documentation as Code**: Use version control for all generated documentation

=== Expected Output

The prompt generates:

* Complete arc42 documentation structure
* Individual AsciiDoc files for each chapter
* Integrated PlantUML diagrams
* Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
* Quality scenarios and requirements
* Risk and technical debt documentation

=== Chapter Generation Process

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Chapters 1-3)
1. **Introduction and Goals**: Establish project context and objectives
2. **Constraints**: Identify limitations and fixed decisions
3. **Context**: Define system boundaries and interfaces

#### Phase 2: Quality and Strategy (Chapters 4, 10)
4. **Solution Strategy**: High-level approach and key decisions
5. **Quality Requirements**: Detailed quality scenarios and criteria

#### Phase 3: Architecture Details (Chapters 5-8)
6. **Building Blocks**: System decomposition and structure
7. **Runtime View**: Dynamic behavior and scenarios
8. **Deployment**: Infrastructure and environment mapping
9. **Cross-cutting Concepts**: Recurring solutions and patterns

#### Phase 4: Decisions and Risks (Chapters 9, 11)
10. **Architecture Decisions**: ADRs with full rationale
11. **Risks and Technical Debt**: Known issues and mitigation

#### Phase 5: Documentation (Chapter 12)
12. **Glossary**: Terms and definitions

=== Integration with ADRs

The prompt automatically:

* Creates separate ADR files for each major decision
* Links ADRs to relevant architecture chapters
* Extracts risks and technical debt from decisions
* Maintains traceability between quality goals and decisions

=== Quality Assurance

Each generated chapter includes:

* **Review Checkpoints**: Points where stakeholder approval is required
* **Consistency Checks**: Ensure alignment across chapters
* **Completeness Validation**: Verify all required information is captured
* **Traceability**: Maintain links between requirements, decisions, and implementation

=== Tips for Best Results

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with high-level concepts, add details iteratively
2. **Use Examples**: Provide concrete examples rather than abstract descriptions
3. **Visual Thinking**: Leverage PlantUML diagrams to clarify concepts
4. **Stakeholder Review**: Regularly review and validate with team members
5. **Version Control**: Treat documentation as code with proper versioning
6. **Living Documentation**: Keep documentation updated as the system evolves
