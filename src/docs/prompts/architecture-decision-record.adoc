== Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Prompt

=== Purpose

Architecture Decision Records document the reasoning behind significant architectural choices. This structured prompt helps create comprehensive ADRs that capture the decision context, alternatives considered, and consequences.

=== Prompt Template

[source,text]
----
You are an experienced software architecture assistant helping me create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR). We will proceed step by step. After each step, ask follow-up questions if needed to ensure precise answers.

== Step 1: Metadata ==
Please collect the following metadata for the ADR:
- ADR ID (e.g., "ADR-001")
- Date of the decision
- Author or team responsible
- Status of the decision (e.g., "Draft," "Final," "Under Review")

== Step 2: Problem Description and Context ==
Describe the problem or challenge that led to this decision:
- What is the current situation?
- What technical or organizational constraints exist?
- Are there existing solutions or systems that the decision must align with?

== Step 3: Preliminary Title (Problem-Focused) ==
Summarize the decision context in a short, concise title that does **not** include the chosen solution.
Example: **"Selecting a database technology for the backend"**
This ensures that the title remains neutral before a decision is made.

== Step 4: Alternative Evaluation with Pugh Matrix ==
Identify relevant alternatives and create a Pugh Matrix for evaluation:
1. Define the **simplest or existing alternative** as the baseline reference.
2. List at least two additional alternatives.
3. Identify key evaluation criteria (e.g., cost, performance, maintainability, complexity).
4. Compare each alternative to the baseline (-1 = worse, 0 = equal, +1 = better).

Fill in the following Pugh Matrix:

| Criterion | Baseline Solution | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2 | Alternative ... |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Cost | 0 | ? | ? | ? |
| Performance | 0 | ? | ? | ? |
| Maintainability | 0 | ? | ? | ? |
| Complexity | 0 | ? | ? | ? |
| **Total Score** | 0 | ? | ? | ? |

Then, explain why certain alternatives were rejected.

== Step 5: Decision ==
Clearly state the chosen decision and justify it based on the results from Step 4.

== Step 6: Consequences ==
Describe the impact of this decision:
- What positive effects are expected?
- What risks are associated with this decision?
- What technical debts are introduced?

**Important:**
Risks and technical debt should be documented in the corresponding chapters of the arc42 architecture documentation.

== Step 7: Finalize the Title ==
Now, update the **preliminary title** to reflect the decision.
Example: **"Selecting a database technology for the backend: PostgreSQL"**

== Step 8: Generate the AsciiDoc Template ==
Use the collected information to create a complete ADR document in AsciiDoc format.

Start with **Step 1: Meta Data**

=== ADR Template Structure

The prompt generates ADRs following this AsciiDoc template:

==== Positive Effects

{DESCRIPTION OF POSITIVE IMPACTS}

==== Risks

{DESCRIPTION OF RISKS}

==== Technical Debt

{DESCRIPTION OF TECHNICAL DEBT}

=== Additional Information

{OPTIONAL REFERENCES, LINKS, OR DOCUMENTS}
----

=== Usage Instructions

1. **One Decision at a Time**: Focus on a single architectural decision
2. **Gather Stakeholders**: Include relevant team members in the decision process
3. **Document Alternatives**: Always consider multiple options, even if one seems obvious
4. **Be Objective**: Use the Pugh Matrix to make data-driven decisions
5. **Track Consequences**: Monitor the actual outcomes vs. expected consequences

=== Expected Output

The prompt will generate:

* A complete ADR in AsciiDoc format
* Structured decision documentation
* Pugh Matrix analysis
* Clear consequences and risks identification
* Professional formatting for integration with documentation tools

=== Integration with arc42

The generated ADRs should be:

* Stored in Chapter 9 (Architecture Decisions) of your arc42 documentation
* Referenced from relevant architecture chapters
* Used to update risk and technical debt sections
* Linked to quality scenarios and requirements
