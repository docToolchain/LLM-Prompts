- High impact on development velocity
- High risk if not addressed
- Relatively low effort to resolve
- Affects critical business functions

**Medium Priority (Plan for Resolution)**:
- Moderate impact on development
- Some risk if not addressed
- Reasonable effort to resolve
- Affects non-critical functions

**Low Priority (Monitor)**:
- Low impact on development
- Low risk if not addressed
- High effort to resolve
- Minimal business impact

# Step 4: Remediation Planning
For each debt item, we'll create:

**Remediation Strategy**:
- **Quick Fix**: Temporary solution to reduce immediate impact
- **Proper Fix**: Complete resolution of the debt
- **Refactor**: Larger restructuring effort
- **Replace**: Complete replacement of the problematic component

**Remediation Plan**:
- Specific steps to resolve the debt
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Testing requirements
- Risk mitigation during remediation

**Timeline and Ownership**:
- Target resolution date
- Assigned owner/team
- Dependencies on other work
- Milestone integration

# Step 5: Documentation Format
Generate the technical debt tracking in this AsciiDoc format:

```

=== Detailed Debt Analysis

==== TD-001: [Debt Title]

**Category**: [Code/Architecture/Design/Documentation/Test/Infrastructure]
**Current Status**: [Identified/Analyzed/Planned/In Progress/Resolved]
**Priority Score**: [Total Score]

**Description**: [Detailed description of the technical debt]

**Location**: [Where in the system this debt exists]

**Root Cause**: [Why this debt was created]

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Development Velocity**: [How it slows down development]
- **Maintenance Cost**: [Ongoing cost of the debt]
- **Quality Risk**: [Risk to system quality]
- **Business Impact**: [Effect on business operations]

**Effort Analysis**:

- **Skills Required**: [What expertise is needed]
- **Dependencies**: [What other work must be done first]

**Priority Scoring**:
- **Impact Score**: [1-5] - [Justification]
- **Effort Score**: [1-5] - [Justification - lower effort = higher score]
- **Risk Score**: [1-5] - [Justification]
- **Business Value Score**: [1-5] - [Justification]
- **Total Priority Score**: [Sum]

**Remediation Plan**:
- **Strategy**: [Quick Fix/Proper Fix/Refactor/Replace]
- **Steps**:
  1. [Step 1]
  2. [Step 2]
  3. [Step 3]
- **Prerequisites**: [What needs to be done first]
- **Testing Approach**: [How to verify the fix]
- **Risk Mitigation**: [How to reduce risks during remediation]

**Timeline and Ownership**:

- **Dependencies**: [Other work that affects timeline]
- **Milestone**: [Project milestone integration]

**Related Items**:
- **Architecture Decisions**: [Related ADRs]
- **Quality Scenarios**: [Related quality requirements]
- **Risks**: [Related risk items]

**Review History**:
- [Date]: [Review notes and status updates]
```

# Step 6: Debt Metrics and Reporting
We'll also track:

**Debt Metrics**:
- Total debt items by category
- Average time to resolution
- Debt creation rate vs. resolution rate
- Impact on development velocity
- Cost of debt (estimated)

**Regular Reviews**:
- Weekly debt triage meetings
- Monthly debt trend analysis
- Quarterly debt strategy reviews
- Annual debt portfolio assessment

Let's start by discussing your project context and identifying the most significant technical debt categories in your system.

=== Usage Instructions

1. **Regular Assessment**: Technical debt should be continuously identified and tracked
2. **Team Involvement**: Include developers, architects, and product owners
3. **Balanced Approach**: Don't try to fix everything at once
4. **Integration**: Link debt items to sprints and project planning
5. **Metrics Tracking**: Monitor debt trends over time

=== Expected Output

The prompt generates:

* Comprehensive technical debt inventory
* Prioritized remediation roadmap
* Detailed analysis and effort estimates
* Integration with project planning
* Metrics for tracking debt trends

=== Integration with Architecture Documentation

Technical debt tracking should:

* Inform architecture decisions (ADRs)
* Connect to quality scenarios and requirements
* Support risk assessment activities
* Guide refactoring and improvement efforts
* Influence technology and design choices
