This document provides a single, comprehensive system prompt that combines all architecture documentation capabilities into one mega-prompt for creating specialized AI assistants focused on software architecture documentation using arc42, docToolchain, and related methodologies.

=== Complete Architecture Documentation Assistant

This consolidated prompt transforms LLMs into expert architecture assistants that can handle all aspects of software architecture documentation, from high-level strategic communication to detailed operational implementation.

=== Usage Instructions

==== For LLM Platforms

1. **Copy the complete prompt** from the source block above
2. **Paste into your LLM interface** as a system prompt or initial message
3. **Begin your architecture work** - the AI will guide you through structured processes for any architecture documentation need

==== For AI Assistant Creation

1. **Use as system prompt** in platforms like:
   - Claude Projects (Anthropic)
   - GPTs (OpenAI)
   - Custom AI assistants
   - API implementations

2. **The AI will have comprehensive capabilities** for:
   - Architecture Communication Canvas creation
   - Architecture Decision Record documentation
   - Complete arc42 documentation generation
   - Quality scenarios and requirements definition
   - Risk assessment and mitigation planning
   - Technical debt identification and management
   - Stakeholder analysis and communication planning
   - System context diagram creation
   - Solution strategy development
   - Deployment architecture design

==== Integration with docToolchain

All generated outputs are designed to work seamlessly with docToolchain:

```bash
# Process generated AsciiDoc files
./dtcw generateHTML
./dtcw generatePDF
./dtcw publishToConfluence
```

=== Capabilities Overview

The consolidated assistant provides:

* **Systematic approaches**: Each capability follows structured, step-by-step processes
* **Quality focus**: All decisions tied to measurable quality goals  
* **Visual integration**: PlantUML/C4 diagrams embedded throughout
* **arc42 alignment**: Direct support for arc42 methodology and chapter structure
* **AsciiDoc output**: Compatible with docToolchain workflows
* **Comprehensive templates**: Ready-to-use documentation structures
* **Decision traceability**: Clear rationale linking requirements to architectural choices
* **Implementation guidance**: Actionable next steps and validation approaches

=== Workflow Integration

The assistant supports complete architecture documentation workflows:

```
Stakeholder Analysis → Context Diagrams → Quality Scenarios 
        ↓
Solution Strategy → Architecture Decisions → Deployment View
        ↓  
Risk Assessment → Technical Debt Tracking → Documentation
```

All outputs integrate seamlessly into comprehensive arc42 documentation covering:

* **Chapter 1**: Introduction and Goals (Architecture Communication Canvas)
* **Chapter 3**: System Scope and Context (Context Diagram Generator)  
* **Chapter 4**: Solution Strategy (Solution Strategy Planner)
* **Chapter 7**: Deployment View (Deployment View Creator)
* **Chapter 9**: Architecture Decisions (Architecture Decision Record)
* **Chapter 10**: Quality Requirements (Quality Scenarios Builder)
* **Chapter 11**: Risk and Technical Debt (Risk Assessment, Technical Debt Tracker)
