=== Problem Description and Context

Our e-commerce platform currently uses a monolithic database architecture where all services (user management, product catalog, orders, inventory) share a single PostgreSQL database. This has led to:

* **Scalability bottlenecks**: Different services have varying load patterns but cannot be scaled independently
* **Performance issues**: Complex queries from the product catalog service impact order processing performance
* **Deployment coupling**: Database schema changes require coordination across all teams
* **Single point of failure**: Any database issue affects the entire platform

The system needs to handle:
* 10M+ active users
* 1M+ products in catalog
* Peak loads of 50,000 concurrent users during sales events
* 99.9% availability SLA requirement

=== Alternative Evaluation (Pugh Matrix)

| Criterion | Shared Database (Baseline) | Database per Service | Shared + Read Replicas | Event Sourcing + CQRS
| **Development Complexity** | 0 | -2 | -1 | -3
| **Operational Complexity** | 0 | -1 | -1 | -2
| **Scalability** | 0 | +3 | +2 | +3
| **Performance** | 0 | +2 | +2 | +3
| **Data Consistency** | 0 | -2 | 0 | -1
| **Team Independence** | 0 | +3 | +1 | +2
| **Cost** | 0 | -1 | -1 | -2
| **Migration Effort** | 0 | -2 | -1 | -3
| **Total Score** | 0 | **0** | **+1** | **-3**

**Rejected Alternatives:**

* **Database per Service**: While providing excellent isolation and scalability, the migration effort and operational complexity were deemed too high for our current team size
* **Event Sourcing + CQRS**: Offers superior performance and scalability but introduces significant complexity that exceeds our team's current expertise

=== Decision

**Selected Solution: Shared Database + Read Replicas**

We will implement a hybrid approach:
1. Maintain the current shared database for write operations
2. Add dedicated read replicas for each major service domain
3. Implement service-specific data access layers
4. Plan for future migration to database per service

This provides immediate performance improvements with manageable complexity while creating a migration path for future architectural evolution.

=== Consequences

==== Positive Effects

* **Immediate performance improvement**: Read replicas will reduce query contention
* **Service isolation**: Each service gets dedicated read capacity
* **Manageable migration**: Low-risk incremental approach
* **Cost effective**: Minimal infrastructure changes required
* **Team readiness**: Builds expertise for future database per service migration

==== Risks

* **Data lag**: Read replicas may have slight delay (< 100ms acceptable)
* **Complexity increase**: Need to manage multiple database connections
* **Partial solution**: Still maintains some coupling through shared write database
* **Future migration debt**: Eventually need to migrate to full service isolation

==== Technical Debt

* **Schema coupling**: Write database still requires cross-team coordination
* **Query optimization**: Need to optimize queries for replica performance
* **Monitoring complexity**: Additional database instances to monitor
* **Connection pooling**: May need to adjust connection pool configurations

=== Additional Information

* **Reference**: Database per Service pattern - https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html
* **Timeline**: Implementation planned for Q3 2024, 8 weeks duration
* **Success Metrics**: 
  - Reduce average query response time by 40%
  - Eliminate read query interference with write operations
  - Maintain 99.9% availability during implementation
