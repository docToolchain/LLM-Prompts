A collection of carefully crafted prompts to help with software architecture documentation using arc42, docToolchain, and related methodologies. These prompts are designed to work with various LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to streamline architecture documentation workflows.

== üèØ What's This About?

Creating good architecture documentation is challenging. These prompts help you:

* Structure your architecture thinking systematically
* Generate consistent, high-quality documentation
* Follow established methodologies like arc42
* Create visual diagrams and decision records
* Maintain documentation as living artifacts

== üöÄ How to Use These Prompts

=== 1. Copy & Paste Approach
Simply copy the prompt content and paste it into your preferred LLM interface.

=== 2. Custom AI Assistant Setup
Use these prompts as system prompts to create specialized AI assistants for architecture work.

=== 3. Integration with docToolchain
These prompts are designed to work seamlessly with https://doctoolchain.org[docToolchain] workflows:

* Output is in AsciiDoc format
* Diagrams use PlantUML/Kroki
* Compatible with arc42 template structure

== üìñ Examples

include::examples/architecture-communication-canvas-example.adoc[]

include::examples/architecture-decision-record-example.adoc[]

include::examples/quality-scenarios-example.adoc[]

== üîó Integration Tips

include::integration/doctoolchain-integration.adoc[]

=== With Confluence
The generated AsciiDoc can be published directly to Confluence using docToolchain:
[source,bash]
----
./dtcw publishToConfluence
----

=== With Version Control
* Store prompts as documentation templates in your repository
* Version control the generated architecture documents
* Use in CI/CD for automated documentation generation

=== With Project Management
* Link architecture decisions to requirements
* Track technical debt in your issue tracking system
* Use risk assessments for project planning

== üé® Customization

These prompts are designed to be customizable:

. **Modify Questions**: Adapt the guiding questions to your domain
. **Adjust Output Format**: Change AsciiDoc styling or structure
. **Add Custom Sections**: Include organization-specific requirements
. **Integrate Tools**: Connect with your existing toolchain

== üî¨ Background & Methodology

=== arc42 Template
These prompts follow the https://arc42.org[arc42 template] structure, which provides:

* Proven documentation structure
* Clear separation of concerns
* Stakeholder-oriented communication
* Pragmatic approach to architecture documentation

=== Architecture Communication Canvas
Based on Gernot Starke's Architecture Communication Canvas, focusing on:

* Value proposition clarity
* Stakeholder identification
* Core functionality emphasis
* Risk and decision transparency

=== Decision Making
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) use:

* Pugh Matrix for objective evaluation
* Structured problem-solution mapping
* Consequence documentation
* Traceability of architectural reasoning

=== Quality-Driven Architecture
Quality Scenarios provide:

* Testable quality requirements
* Objective success criteria
* Architecture decision guidance
* Validation frameworks

=== Risk-Driven Development
Risk Assessment includes:

* Systematic risk identification
* Impact and probability evaluation
* Mitigation strategy development
* Continuous risk monitoring

== üîÑ Workflow Integration

=== Recommended Usage Sequence

. **Start with Architecture Communication Canvas** - Get the big picture
. **Use arc42 Chapter Generator** - Create comprehensive documentation
. **Build Quality Scenarios** - Define testable requirements
