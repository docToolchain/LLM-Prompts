## üöÄ How to Use These Prompts

### 1. Copy & Paste Approach
Simply copy the prompt content and paste it into your preferred LLM interface.

### 2. Custom AI Assistant Setup
Use these prompts as system prompts to create specialized AI assistants for architecture work.

### 3. Integration with docToolchain
These prompts are designed to work seamlessly with [docToolchain](https://doctoolchain.org) workflows:
- Output is in AsciiDoc format
- Diagrams use PlantUML/Kroki
- Compatible with arc42 template structure

## üìñ Examples

### Architecture Communication Canvas Example

When you use the Architecture Communication Canvas prompt, you'll get an interactive session like this:

```
üîñ Let's create your Architecture Communication Canvas! 

First, let's understand the value proposition of your system.
What are the system's major objectives? What value does it deliver to customers?

üë§ We're building an e-commerce platform that enables small businesses to sell online...

üîñ Great! Now let's identify your key stakeholders.
Who are your most important customers and contributors?
```

The result is a comprehensive one-page architecture overview in AsciiDoc format.

### Architecture Decision Record Example

The ADR prompt guides you through a structured decision-making process:

1. **Problem Context**: What needs to be decided?
2. **Alternatives Evaluation**: Using Pugh Matrix for objective comparison
3. **Decision Rationale**: Clear justification based on evaluation
4. **Consequences**: Both positive effects and risks

### Quality Scenarios Example

The Quality Scenarios Builder helps create testable requirements:

```
Scenario: Normal User Response Time
Quality Attribute: Performance
Context: Normal business operation with up to 500 concurrent users
Stimulus: User submits a search query
Response: System returns search results
Response Measure: 95% of queries return results within 200ms
Priority: High
```

## üîó Integration Tips

### With docToolchain
```bash
# Add generated AsciiDoc files to your docToolchain project
./dtcw generateHTML
./dtcw generatePDF
```

### With Confluence
The generated AsciiDoc can be published directly to Confluence using docToolchain:
```bash
./dtcw publishToConfluence
```

### With Version Control
- Store prompts as documentation templates in your repository
- Version control the generated architecture documents
- Use in CI/CD for automated documentation generation

### With Project Management
- Link architecture decisions to requirements
- Track technical debt in your issue tracking system
- Use risk assessments for project planning

## üé® Customization

These prompts are designed to be customizable:

1. **Modify Questions**: Adapt the guiding questions to your domain
2. **Adjust Output Format**: Change AsciiDoc styling or structure
3. **Add Custom Sections**: Include organization-specific requirements
4. **Integrate Tools**: Connect with your existing toolchain

## üìö Background & Methodology

### arc42 Template
These prompts follow the [arc42 template](https://arc42.org) structure, which provides:
- Proven documentation structure
